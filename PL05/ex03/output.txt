Anitta, Anitta, so glad to meet ya!
I'm big Snoop Dogg, and I'll be the feature
Born and bred in the LBC
All about the DBG
Gin and juice, chronic weed (balançou, boom boom)
C'mon, girl, put that thing on me
If I was you and you was me
Would you do what I'm 'bout to do?
(Hell, yeah, do it to em', uncle Snoop!)
Take flight, make life
Look just like the video
You looking so pretty, yo (boom boom, balançou)
Take me to your city, yo
Bring a bunch of girls, ain't no need for no fellas
I pay them boys a visit when I slay through the favelas
Smoke it up, burn it up
Light it up, pour it up
G's up, hoes down (boom boom, balançou)
Back it up, now turn it up (turn it up)
I am the process with PID 5072.

I am the process with PID 5171.

I am the process with PID 5415.

I am the process with PID 5420.
