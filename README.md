## ‚öôÔ∏è Compilation and Execution

### **General Compilation**
For exercises with Makefiles:
```bash
cd PLXX/exYY
make
make run
```

### **Manual Compilation**
For threading exercises (PL06):
```bash
gcc -pthread -o prog1 prog1.c
./prog1
```

For semaphore exercises (PL05):
```bash
gcc -lrt -o prog1 prog1.c
./prog1
```

For shared memory exercises (PL04):
```bash
gcc -lrt -o prog1 prog1.c
gcc -lrt -o prog2 prog2.c
./prog1 &
./prog2
```

### **Cleanup**
```bash
make clean  # Remove object files
```

## üîí Synchronization Patterns

1. **Producer-Consumer**: File writing with controlled access
2. **Mutual Exclusion**: Preventing concurrent file corruption
3. **Sequential Coordination**: Ordered process execution
4. **Resource Protection**: Semaphore-based file locking
